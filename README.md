# Working with lubridate()


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the modern approach to handling dates and times in R using the lubridate package. Working with dates and times is a critical component in many data analysis workflows, and lubridate simplifies this process by providing a consistent set of functions for parsing, manipulating, and performing arithmetic on date-time data. The package offers a grammar specifically designed for date and time handling, making it easier to parse complex dates, extract specific time components, and perform operations like adding durations, creating intervals, and adjusting for time zones.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the lubridate package and handling dates/times data, (2) show you the key verbs of the package, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.


## Tutorial

The session is accompanied by a tutorial, which can be accessed [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/intro-to-data-science-24/labs/02e4175f0b23aef7e2c79ca67cf1e7da29520e2b/session-03-tidyverse-functions/3-tidyverse-functions.html).
